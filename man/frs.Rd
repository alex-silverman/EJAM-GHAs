\title{frs (DATA) EPA Facility Registry Service table of regulated sites}
\description{
This is a data.table snapshot version of the EPA FRS.
You can look up sites by REGISTRY_ID in \link{frs}, and get their location, etc.
}
\details{
This dataset can be updated by a package maintainer by using
frs_update_datasets() (which is not an exported function)

The definitions of active/inactive here are not quite the
same as used in ECHO. See attributes(frs) to see date created, etc.

Also, EJScreen has maps of EPA-regulated facilities of a few program types,
as provided here: \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20250118193121/https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/ejscreen-map-descriptions#sites-reporting-to-epa}
and for a table of acronym definitions
