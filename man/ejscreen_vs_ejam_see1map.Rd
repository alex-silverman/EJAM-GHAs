  overlay_blockgroups = FALSE,
  radius = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{vs}{results from  vs <- ejscreen_vs_ejam(testpoints_10, radius = 3, include_ejindexes = TRUE)}

\item{n}{row number in vs$EJAM of site to check}

\item{overlay_blockgroups}{optional, set TRUE to see overlay of boundaries of parent blockgroups,
noting that you have to click to turn off the layer for block point info popups to work}

\item{map}{set to FALSE to suppress drawing map but still return block-level info}

\item{extramiles2check}{miles of additional radius to look in for possible extra blocks that may have been missed by EJAM}

\item{extra_blocks2check_almost_at_radius}{how many blocks to check that are almost as far as radius,
in addition to the number that the blockcount is off by}

\item{extra_blocks2check_beyond_radius}{how many blocks to check that are almost just beyond radius,
in addition to the number that the blockcount is off by}

\item{...}{passed to \code{\link[=plotblocksnearby]{plotblocksnearby()}}}
}
\value{
Just draws map and shows tables and returns the table of blocks near the site
and info on how much the distance and pop count differ from what EJAM thinks
is the actual exact radius, with possible explanation of discrepancy
between ejscreen api and ejam estimate,
but you may also want the output of ejscreen_vs_ejam_see1()
