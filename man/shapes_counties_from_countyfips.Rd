Get Counties boundaries via API, to map them
}
\details{
Used \code{\link[sf:st_read]{sf::read_sf()}}, which is an alias for \code{\link[sf:st_read]{sf::st_read()}}
but with some modified default arguments.
read_sf is quiet by default/ does not print info about data source, and
read_sf returns an sf-tibble rather than an sf-data.frame

Also note the tidycensus and tigris R packages.
