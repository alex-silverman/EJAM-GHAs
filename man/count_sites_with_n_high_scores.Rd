\title{Answers questions like how many sites have certain indicators >2x the state avg?}
\usage{
count_sites_with_n_high_scores(
  scores,
  thresholds = NULL,
  indicator_type = c("percentile", "ratio", "other")[2],
  xwide = c("", "statewide", "nationwide")[1],
  site_stat_type = c("cum_pct", "cum_count", "pct", "count")[1],
  text_suffix = c("th percentile", " times the average", "")[match(indicator_type,
    c("percentile", "ratio", "other"))],
  text_indicatortype = "indicators",
  quiet = !interactive()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{scores in a table with one row per place and one column per indicator}

\item{thresholds}{thresholds vector of numbers as benchmarks. Assuming the indicators
in the scores table are ratios to the average, then the thresholds could be
for example, 1.50, 2, etc. which would represent ratios that are 1.5x or 2x etc.}

\item{indicator_type}{Scores and benchmarks are percentiles, ratios,
or anything else. One of these: c("percentile", "ratio", "other")}

\item{xwide}{must be "statewide" or "nationwide" -- used only in the text output
that describes the findings.}

\item{site_stat_type}{Count or share of sites, exactly or cumulatively.
One of these: c("cum_pct", "cum_count", "pct", "count")}

\item{text_suffix}{If using ratios, use the default, which explains these
thresholds as X times the average.
If using percentiles as thresholds, set text_suffix = "."
or text_suffix = "th percentile in the state." for example}

\item{text_indicatortype}{can be "Summary Indexes" etc.}

\item{quiet}{whether to print findings to console}
}
\value{
Returns a list with two named elements, "stats" and "text" where
stats is a 3-dimensional array of numbers. See dimnames(output$stats).
}
\description{
This function provides tables of summary stats but also text
that explains those findings in plain English. It relies on \code{\link[=colcounter_summary_all]{colcounter_summary_all()}}
}
\details{
Helps provide stat summaries such as:

(x\%) of these (sites) have

at least (N) of these (YTYPE )indicators

at least (R) times the (State/National average)
}
