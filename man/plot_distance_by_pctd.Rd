\usage{
plot_distance_by_pctd(
  s2b = NULL,
  sitenumber = 1,
  score_colname = names_these[3],
  scorewts_colname = "pop",
  score_label = fixcolnames(score_colname, "r", "shortlabel"),
  radius = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s2b}{output of \code{\link[=getblocksnearby]{getblocksnearby()}}, or else can be
a table of points with lat,lon columns and 1 row per point.
If NULL (not provided as a parameter to the function),
will prompt for a file to upload and use, if interactive() is TRUE, or else
the function will just show an example using a random point.}

\item{sitenumber}{If used, one number that is the unique ID
(the row number of original list of points) to look at in s2b.
This should be the same as the value of s2b$ejam_uniq_id for
the site to be analyzed.
Will be able to omit or set to NULL to use overall aggregate of all sites.}

\item{score_colname}{colname in blockgroupstats for an indicator to be
aggregated across blocks and blockgroups as a weighted mean}

\item{scorewts_colname}{colname in blockgroupstats -- like "pop" -- for the weight
to use in aggregating the scores referred to by score_colname}

\item{score_label}{optional friendly label for the variable}

\item{radius}{optional radius to use as maximum analyzed or shown --
if s2b was provided, this caps what is used and only shorter radii get shown
(only relevant if s2b had radii larger than this radius parameter)
and if s2b is not provided, interactively RStudio user is prompted
to provide latlon file to analyze in getblocksnearby() and
radius is used in that.}
}
\value{
returns s2b but with more columns in it like wtdmean_within
}
\description{
*** DRAFT - NEED TO RECHECK CALCULATIONS
This plots the cumulative share of residents found within each distance,
for a single population group.
}
\details{
Also see ejamit_compare_distances() for a plot  of several indicators at several distances!

This function uses the distance of each Census block from the site in conjunction with
the block group residential population data, to provide a relatively detailed picture of
how far away residents in each group live. In contrast, the function
\code{\link[=distance_cdf_by_group_plot]{distance_cdf_by_group_plot()}} is based on ejamit()$results_bybg_people,
which provides only block group resolution information about distance.

 # Example of area where \%Black is
 # very high within 1 mile but drops by 3 miles away
 pts = testpoints_100[3,]
