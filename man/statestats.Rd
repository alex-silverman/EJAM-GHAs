\description{
data.frame of 100 percentiles and means
for each US State and PR and DC
for all the block groups in that zone (e.g., block groups in \link{blockgroupstats})
for a set of indicators such as percent low income.
Each column is one indicator (or specifies the percentile).

This should be similar to the lookup tables in the gdb on the FTP site of EJScreen,
except it also has data for additional population subgroups.
See also \link{usastats} for more details.
