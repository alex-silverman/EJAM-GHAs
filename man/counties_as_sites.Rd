\usage{
counties_as_sites(fips)
}
\arguments{
\item{fips}{County FIPS vector,
like fips_counties_from_state_abbrev("DE")}
}
\value{
provides table similar to the output of getblocksnearby(),
data.table with one row per blockgroup in these counties, or
all pairs of county fips - bgid, and ejam_uniq_id (1 through N) assigned to each county
but missing blockid and distance so not ready for doaggregate().
}

FIPS - Analyze US Counties as if they were sites, to get summary indicators summary for each county
}
\details{
This function provides one row per blockgroup.
\code{\link[=getblocksnearby_from_fips]{getblocksnearby_from_fips()}} provides one row per block.
