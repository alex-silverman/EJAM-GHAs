identify the State each site is in, for doaggregate()

\examples{
\donttest{

 # cannot quickly id ST if a site spans 2+ states
 # not this is an unexported function:
 tail(state_from_s2b_bysite(testoutput_getblocksnearby_100pts_1miles))
 
 # using the closest block can id the wrong state:
 tail(state_from_nearest_block_bysite(testoutput_getblocksnearby_100pts_1miles))
 
 # getting the true state is slow if some sites span 2+ states:
