\title{Get lat lon, Registry ID, and NAICS, for given FRS Program System ID}
\usage{
latlon_from_programid(programname, programid)
}
\arguments{
\item{programname}{name of EPA program that the programid is from:
"RCRAINFO" is the programname and "XJW000000174" is the programid
if the full record was  RCRAINFO:XJW000000174}

\item{programid}{like "XJW000000174"
"RCRAINFO" is the programname and "XJW000000174" is the programid
if the full record was  RCRAINFO:XJW000000174}
}
\value{
data.table with lat  lon  REGISTRY_ID  program   pgm_sys_id
}
\description{
Get lat lon, Registry ID, and NAICS, for given FRS Program System ID
}
\details{
The ID is the identification number, such as the permit number,
assigned by an information management system that represents a
facility site, waste site, operable unit, or other feature tracked by that
Environmental Information System.

see \link{epa_programs} for a list of programs and their acronyms and a count
of FRS facilities under each.
Also see a simple lilst of names like this:
as.vector(epa_programs)
or
sort(unique(frs_by_programid$program))

There are roughly 3.5 million records in \link{frs_by_programid} but only
about 2.7 million unique pgm_sys_id values because the same number
may be used under different program types, like RCRAINFO AND EGRID.

These are two distinct facilities both using the number 1:

latlon_from_programid('EGRID', 1)
latlon_from_programid('ICIS', 1)

Also note the FRS API:

\url{https://www.epa.gov/frs/frs-rest-services}

\examples{
 ids = c("00603DSCFPRD459", "00603MCRNTRD11K", "00605VNMRBMONTA" )
 latlon_from_programid("TRIS", ids) 
 
 latlon_from_programid('EGRID', 1) 
 latlon_from_programid('ICIS', 1)
 
 # ambiguous to only use the number! 354362 is used by two programs here:
 frs_by_programid[match(testinput_program_sys_id, frs_by_programid$pgm_sys_id), ]
 frs_by_programid[frs_by_programid$pgm_sys_id \%in\% testinput_program_sys_id, ]
