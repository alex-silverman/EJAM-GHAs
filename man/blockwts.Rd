blockwts is a table of all census blocks, with the weights reflecting
what fraction of the parent block group census 2020 population lived in
that block.  The weights are used to aggregate block-level data to blockgroup,
for cases where only some of the blockgroup is in a circular buffer or polygon.

It also has a column
called \code{blockid} that can join it to other block datasets.
