<code><a href="ejscreenit.html">ejscreenit()</a></code> uses functions below, but returns a list with table, map, plot, etc.
<code>ejscreenapi_plus()</code> accepts file or table or vectors of point data,
uses <code><a href="ejscreenapi.html">ejscreenapi()</a></code> to get EJScreen stats,
and then prepends input table and renames columns, to return a table.
<code><a href="ejscreenapi.html">ejscreenapi()</a></code>    gets EJ stats for many points as a data.table of many rows.
<code><a href="ejscreenapi1.html">ejscreenapi1()</a></code> gets EJ stats for 1 point via API, as data.frame of 1 row.
<code><a href="ejscreenRESTbroker.html">ejscreenRESTbroker()</a></code> gets EJ stats for one point as JSON.</p>
<p>It also now drops redundant columns where the same numbers had been returned from API
using the normal name and a synonym name, as with TOTALPOP and "totalPop"</p>
