# Executive Summary

EPA has conducted an analysis to characterize baseline environmental
conditions faced by communities living near `r params$sectorname_short`.
  or 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) analyzed
baseline residential population and environmental conditions in communities living
`r params$where`. The analysis used EPA's EJAM tool and EJScreen version
`r params$ejscreen_version` with demographic data based on the Census
Bureau's `r params$acs_version` American Community Survey (ACS).

## Broad overview of findings

PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE The environmental indicators -- especially proximity
scores -- are more notable than the residential population indicators at these
sites. Residential population percentage indicators for analyzed groups are moderately above average overall.



## Summary of Findings

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
SEE notes on summarizer draft function 
and examples of using count_sites_with_n_high_scores()
```

-   PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE Overall, % limited English
    proficiency, and the Demographic Indicator are more than 1.5x the
    State rate, for the population within 1 mile.

-   PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE About a third of these sites are above the 80th
    percentile in State for the Demographic Indicator. The same is true
    for % low income and % with less than high school.

-   PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE About half of these 57 sites are in just 4
    states: FL, NY, PA, or MA. Most of the people here live near just 8
    sites (15% of sites). Most of the sites with the higher demographic
    indicators are owned by Covanta or Wheelabrator.

-   PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE Many of the sites with the highest demographic
    indicators also have proximity scores that are 5 to 10 times the
    State average.

    -   PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE The average person's RMP score is more than
        3x their State's average.
    -   PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE The average person's NPL and TSDF scores are
        about 2.5x State averages.
    -   PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE Most of these sites are \>=80th in State for
        Air Toxics. Same for RMP.

# Introduction





# Methods

## Selection of sites analyzed

This analysis focused on locations `r params$sectorname_short`, which
are the sites that may be affected by the proposal rule. The latitude
and longitude of a point representing each site was obtained from
`r params$source_of_latlons`. A total of `r params$sitecount` sites had
location information and were analyzed.

Figure \ref{fig1} shows a map of the sites analyzed.

## Figure \ref{fig1} Map of Analyzed Sites

```{r fig1, fig.cap = "\\label{fig1}Map of Analyzed Sites", echo=FALSE,  out.height='280px', out.width='600px'}

# print(params)

# if (file.exists(params$map_placeholder_png)) {
if (params$testmode) {
  knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$map_placeholder_png)
} else {
  params$map
  #print( params$map )
}

# # did not work, not sure why:
# if (!("map" %in% names(params))  ) {
#   (knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$map_placeholder_png))
# } else {

#    (knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$map_placeholder_png))
# } else {
#   print( params$map )
# }
# }

```

## Estimating locations and residential population counts

The Environmental and Residential Population Analysis Multisite tool (EJAM) was used to develop this analysis. This tool is a user-friendly web app that can summarize residential population and environmental conditions for any list of places in the nation.

### Spatial resolution of data

The analysis used the multisite tool version
`r params$ejscreen_version` with residential population data based on the Census
Bureau's `r params$acs_version` American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year
summary file, and the corresponding version of Decennial Census
information on geographic boundaries and FIPS codes for blocks, block
groups, tracts, counties, and States. Demographic and environmental
indicators were at block group resolution, while locations of
residential populations was at block resolution (the highest resolution
available from the Census Bureau) and then summarized by block group,
then by location analyzed, and finally overall across the locations as a
whole.

See EJAM package documentation for methodology details.

### Analytic method for buffering, and tools used to implement that method

The basic methodology and data used for this analysis are the same as
those originally developed for EPA's EJScreen tool, with a few exceptions described
below. These are described in detail in EJScreen's documentation, at
[EJScreen]https://web.archive.org/web/20250118193121/https://epa.gov/ejscreen "EPA EJScreen homepage"){.uri
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and with more technical
details available at [EJScreen technical documentation
page](https://web.archive.org/web/20250118072723/https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/technical-information-and-data-downloads "EPA EJScreen technical information"){.uri
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

EJAM identifies residents near a given site by finding
which Census block points are nearby, and counting the full block
population as nearby if that point is nearby. The percent of each block
group's population that is estimated as inside a buffer is based on
which Census block internal points are included in the buffer, and then
using a block weight that is the Census 2020 block population as a
fraction of the parent block group's Census 2020 population (which is
not quite the same as the ACS population count). That block weight is a
fraction of the parent block group, and is used to estimate how many of
the block groups residents are nearby or in the buffer.

The only notable differences between the EJScreen and EJAM calculations
of proximity and indicators are the following:

-   EJAM may include additional demographic or environmental indicators, and 
not all of the extra indicators in EJScreen are included in EJAM.
-   For a proximity analysis (to characterize everyone living within a
certain certain distance from a point such as a facility), EJAM identifies which
residents live nearby using a slight variation on how the distance to each
Census block is measured. While EJScreen uses ESRI's ArcGIS calculations, EJAM
calculates the distance using formulas implemented in the R language for
statistical computing [@R-base]. These measurements provide almost identical
results for estimated distance from the average person in a block to a given
site point. PLACEHOLDER MORE INFO
-   EJAM aggregates indicator values within and across locations,
converts them to percentiles, and does other summary calculations using the same
formulas to the greatest extent possible, but in R rather than using ArcGIS/ESRI/Python code. There may be slight differences between raw scores and percentiles in
EJScreen and EJAM in some cases.

## Residential population and environmental indicators

The residential population statistics included here are those in EJScreen and also
race/ethnicity subgroups that comprise the total count of people of
color. POC are defined as all other than those self-identifying in ACS
survey data as white, single race, not Hispanic or Latino - i.e.,
non-hispanic white alone (NHWA). The subgroups include Hispanic or
Latino ("hispanic"), several groups that are not hispanic but of only
single race (e.g., Asian, or more specifically non-hispanic asian
alone), non-hispanic other single race, and non-hispanic multiracial.

# Findings

## Text on Findings

### Results -- Basic information about the locations analyzed and number of people nearby

• Explain whether the sites are to be analyzed as a whole or in some
type of subgroups, such as 2 different source categories, or large vs
small facilities, or some other categories we will use to compare all
these stats?

• Count of locations

• Locations missing data There were several sites where EJScreen did not
return any stats, typically (or always) because of low population
density nearby (within 1 mile in this case). • Where are the sites
(regions, states, cities?, urban/rural?)

• Clustering (are they near each other? How close? Which ones are in
clusters, maybe?)

• Total population near any of the sites (count of unique residents) and
some summary of site-specific Population sizes and population density
nearby (what % of all people are at x% of the sites? etc.). Make clear to what
extent some people in the overall summary stats are near more than a
single one of these sites. See text in Advanced vignette section on density.

### Demographics overall

Overall summary statement of some kind - e.g., a " very large" number of
all the envt (or D) indicators were " very high" at a " very
large" share of the sites or preferably for a " very large share of the
people"? Or, how many of 13 indicators were "high" for the average
person and/or site overall? Somehow put that in context ?? vs other
rules, usA, other sites, etc.???

Table 1 shows key results for the analysis of demographics in these
locations. The table shows each demographic group's share of the
residential population in these locations and conpares that to their
shares of statewide and nationwide population.

## Data Table 1. Demographic Indicators

```{r demog_table, echo=FALSE, out.width='900px'}

if (params$testmode) {
  knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$demog_table_placeholder_png)
} else {
   params$demog_table
}
# 
# if (any(is.na(params$demog_table)) | "NA" != (params$demog_table)) {
# params$demog_table
# } else {
#   knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$demog_table_placeholder_png)
#   # not sure how to do this here:
#   #  print(gt::render_gt(params$demog_table_placeholder_rda))
# }
```

Almost all the EJ-relevant groups (low-income, people of color, etc.)
are at least somewhat over-represented near these sites overall (at the
collection of sites as a whole).

Most notably, % with limited English, % low income, and % with less than
high school education near these sites are about 1.5 to 1.7 times the US
overall rates.

The people living near these sites are 40% more likely to be in
Limited-English Households than the average US resident.

The % with limited English is driven by high scores at only a few very
highly population sites -- it is high enough that the rate overall is in
the top quintile nationally (83 percentile), but other demographics do
not reach the top quintile for the entire population across all sites as
a whole.

Near most of these 72 sites, % low income is at least 1.3x the rate in
the US overall, and near 1 in 4 it is at least 1.5x the US rate.

if (params$testmode) {
  knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$barplot_placeholder_png)
} else {
  params$barplot
#print( params$barplot  )
}

# if ("NA" == (params$barplot)) {
#  knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$barplot_placeholder_png)
# } else {
#   params$barplot  
# }
```

### Key D group(s) based on policy or default / Key D group(s) based on observed magnitude of disparities here

Largest disparity in presence of any group -- which group was most
over-represented here?

-   Relative disparity vs US: Which group(s) had the largest ratio of
    local % (for the overall set of sites) to US % overall?

-   Absolute disparity vs US: which group(s) had

"Large" disparities: which groups were "very" over-represented here?

-   Which indicator has max mean percentile? And how high is that?

-   Which indicator has largest ratio to US? To state? And how large is
    that?

### Demographics at key sites

Overall summary statement of some kind - e.g., a "\_\_\_very large"
number of all the envt (or D) indicators were "\_\_\_very high" at
a "\_\_\_very large" share of the sites or preferably for a "\_\_\_very
large share of the people"? Or, how many of 13 indicators were "high"
for the average person and/or site overall? Somehow put that in context
?? vs other rules, usA, other sites, etc.???

Demographic stats on the distribution across sites/people

• What % or count of people/sites have score \> key thresholds?

• What is mean or median or 95th pctile score of people/sites ?

• NOTABLE "WORST" SITES NAMES?

There are a handful of sites each with at least one very high
demographic stat within 1 mile, however this may be within the normal
range of what one would expect across the range of US residential areas
-- there does not appear to be a pattern of an unusually large share of
these 72 sites having any given demographic stat in the top 5%, for
example.

Seven key sites have at least some demographic percentages more than 2x
the US average: Crawford in Chicago IL (densely populated location), Bay
Shore in Ohio, Watts Bar Fossil Plant in Spring City TN (but has almost
no nearby residents), Arkwright in Macon GA, Venice in IL, Lake Shore in
Cleveland, and Fair Station in Muscatine IA.

At two sites, percent people of color and percent low income are both
more than twice the US averages (Venice and Lake Shore).

A few sites have over triple the US average unemployment rate (two of
which are in the top 5% nationwide for their rate of unemployment, Bay
Shore and Watts Bar).

## Data Viz 3 -- Boxplots

```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE,  out.height='500px', out.width='800px'}
#if (params$testmode) {
   knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$boxplot_placeholder_png)
#} else {
#     params$boxplot +
#   ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) stringr::str_wrap(x, 10)) +
#   ggplot2::theme(plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12),
#         plot.subtitle = ggplot2::element_text(hjust=0.5, size=11),
#         axis.title.y = ggplot2::element_text(size=10),
#         axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(size=9)
#         )
# }
# if ("NA" == (params$boxplot)) {
# 
# } else {

# }
```

### Environment overall

The people living near these sites as a whole are facing relatively
high exposure to indicators of RMP proximity and possible lead paint due
to older buildings. Overall the average person nearby has RMP proximity
more than 3 times the US average. Lead paint and traffic are also
notable, at more than 2x the US average. The average person near any of
these sites lives in a blockgroup that is at the 80th percentile (worst
quintile) of the US for RMP and lead paint -- that is unusual because it
is a pattern for these populations as a whole not just at one site. The
same is almost true for traffic and UST -- the average person nearby has
those indicators in the worst quartile of the US. (Wastewater and
Superfund also tend to be very high at an unusually large share of these
sites but not necessarily at the ones in highly populated areas).

• Overall summary statement of some kind. e.g., a "\_\_\_very large"
number of all the envt (or D) indicators were "\_\_\_very high" at
a "\_\_\_very large" share of the sites or preferably for a "\_\_\_very
large share of the people"? Or, how many of 13 indicators were "high"
for the average person and/or site overall? Somehow put that in context
?? vs other rules, usA, other sites, etc.???

• Which indicator has max mean percentile? And how high is that?

• Which indicator has largest ratio to US? To state? And how large is
that?

# }
```

### Environmental indicators distribution across the residents and sites

• What % or count of people/sites have score \> key thresholds?

• What is mean or median or 95th pctile score of people/sites ?

• NOTABLE "WORST" SITES NAMES?

### Environment at key sites

There are an unusually large number of sites with very high
environmental stats within 1 mile. Surprisingly, 27 of these 72 sites
have at least one above the 95th percentile. One might expect 5% of
these sites (i.e., 3.6 sites) to have a given score in the top 5%
nationwide, but there are 8 sites (2x what one might expect) with RMP
proximity scores in the top 5%, and the same is true for Superfund NPL
proximity scores (there are 8 sites \>=95th %ile instead of the expected
3.6). For the wastewater discharge indicator, there are 11 such sites,
over 3x as many as one might expect. Most sites have at least one
environmental indicator \>80th percentile.

### Cumulative impacts at key sites

Multiple environmental stressors are also an issue in some cases - At
two of the sites, there are five environmental indicators that are all
more than twice the US average (Valley and Crawford).

### Combination of demographic and environmental conditions in these locations

Summary of Envt and Demog across all indicators? In other words, a
single score like the combination of 13 summary indexes as a threshold
approach summary? e.g. the average person had 5 or more of the 13 summary
indexes at least at the 95th percentile nationwide?

• Individual summary indicator of 13 that generally had highest overall
percentiles? On average highest vs the one where at least a few sites
had a very high number? Other?

• User specified summary index(es)?

### Appendix 4 - notes on how to describe places generically/ in parameters

HOW TO REFER TO THE PLACES STUDIED (near these facilities vs more
general language)

Note: this could be a "proximity analysis" in cases where it relies on
circular buffers around facility points to define buffers that include
residents within a fixed distance from one or more facilities/sites. But
it more generally could be an EJ analysis that describes environmental
and demographic conditions among residents in any specified places, such
as all the places where air quality modeling suggests risk is currently
above 1 in 1 million, for example. So the language should be flexible
and refer to something like this:

FOR NON-PROXIMITY ANALYSIS, GENERALLY ANY KIND OF BUFFERS/PLACES
ANALYZED:

The demographics of residents in ...

The demographic / environmental indicators in ...

Percent low income among residents in ...

The environmental conditions in ...

The environmental indicators for the average resident in ...

The PM2.5 levels in ...

Residents in ...

... these locations

... these places

... these areas

... the analyzed locations

FOR PROXIMITY ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY, EASIER TO SAY one of these:

Residents / conditions ...

... within x miles of these sites...

... within x miles of any of these sites...

... nearby

... near these sites

... near any of these sites

## Notes on formatting for a manuscript

This manuscript will follow the guidelines in the Guide for Authors of
the relevant journal. For detailed instructions on the elsevier
article class, see
<https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions>

## Bibliography styles

Here are two sample references: [@Feynman1963118; @Dirac1953888]. 

By default, natbib will be used with the `authoryear` style, set in the 
`classoption` variable in a YAML. 
You can set  extra options with 
`natbiboptions` variable in a YAML header:
#``` yaml
#natbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon
#```

There are various more specific bibliography styles available at
<https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files>.
To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example,
`biblio-style: model1-num-names`.

If `citation_package` is set to `default` in `elsevier_article()`, then
pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`.
