## Notes for developers, on running unit tests in this package

Modified or new functions in the EJAM package should be tested using unit tests.
See https://testthat.r-lib.org 

There are numerous unit tests in the `EJAM/tests/testthat/` folder that you can run
and add to as needed. They can be run automatically by the [devtools::test()] function.

However, instead of running all the unit tests (run in alphabetical order by default), 
you might want to test only some groups of related functions that you are working on,
and see a summary of which tests in which files from which groups are passing, skipped, etc. 
To do this, note there is a file called `EJAM/tests/test_interactively.R` 
that you can [source()] and then you can use that function to run the unit tests interactively.

Assuming you want to use that function, 
whenever you add or rename or delete unit test files in the `EJAM/tests/testthat/` folder you 
need to edit the list of test file names in the source code of that function, test_interactively()
or you can try to use it and it will stop and tell you which files are missing from the list in the source code at `EJAM/tests/test_interactively.R` 

Note there is also a github workflow that runs unit tests (using the installed version of the package?? - check this), automatically triggered by certain events, such as a pull request to the main or development branch. See
`EJAM/.github/workflows/run-test.yaml`

Some functions relied on the EJScreen API and if the API is not available, those tests will fail.
Those tests could be modified to be skipped in that case.
