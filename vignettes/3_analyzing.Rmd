This article provides examples of how to use EJAM in RStudio, especially how to use more specialized functions to find specific places to analyze, such as EPA-regulated facilities defined in various ways, and how to explore the results in more detail than the web app can provide.

# Running a Basic Analysis

-   **`run_app()`** launches the web app locally (to run in RStudio on a single computer rather than on a server)

-   **`ejamit()`** provides most results in just one function (if you already have a list of places to analyze), as shown in the [Quick Start Guide](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/articles/2_quickstart.html)

# Tools for Exploring Results

For a standard analysis, the basic tools like `ejam2report()`, `ejam2excel()`, `ejam2map()`, etc. let you explore results, as shown in the [Quick Start Guide](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/articles/2_quickstart.html).

If you want more ways to visualize and dig into results, examples are provided below in the sections on [EXPLORING RESULTS] and [VISUALIZATION OF FINDINGS (PLOTS)]. For example, you can check which groups or which facilities have notable findings.

# Tools for Selecting Locations to Analyze

EJAM offers a variety of ways to specify the places to be analyzed and compared. The web app helps you select locations in several ways.

If you are working in RStudio, and you already have identified the points or areas to analyze, the [ejamit()] function will accept 1) point coordinates, 2) a shapefile, or 3) a list of FIPS codes.

However, if you first need to get the points (lat, lon values), or you need a more in-depth, custom approach to finding facilities or Census places to analyze, there are several groups of functions to help with that, as shown in all the examples below. They are also shown in the [EJAM package reference manual](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/reference/index.html), by category.

You can specify locations for analysis in a variety of ways:

-   **Near each point:** Specify points and analyze residents who are [NEAR EACH POINT (PROXIMITY ANALYSIS)]
    -   [**Latitude and Longitude**]
    -   [**Facilities by ID**] can be defined [by Facility, using EPA Registry ID] or [by Facility, using EPA Program System ID]
    -   [**Facilities by Type**] can be defined [by Industry (NAICS)] or [Facilities by Type] or by Clean Air Act source category defined by [by MACT Subpart (hazardous air pollutant source category)]
-   **Within each polygon:** Specify areas of any size and shape to analyze residents within each polygon/zone/area (based on shapefiles or Census FIPS codes)
    -   **within areas or zones** on a map if you have GIS data in [SHAPEFILES] - Polygons (from shapefiles) could for example define redlining zones, higher risk areas based on modeling, etc.
    -   **within Census units like cities or Counties** defined using [FIPS CODES] - Census Units such as Counties or other types of Census Units are defined by FIPS code (e.g., Counties in one State).

# NEAR EACH POINT (PROXIMITY ANALYSIS)

## Latitude and Longitude

You can define locations as all residents within X miles of any one or more of the specified points, and you can define those points in a few ways. One way is to upload a table of coordinates -- latitude and longitude for each point, one row per site, with columns called lat and lon (or some synonyms that work). There are also [more detailed functions for working with latlon coordinates.](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/reference/index.html#specify-points-by-lat-lon)

The simplest way to do that in the RStudio console is something like `x <- ejamit()`, which prompts you to upload a spreadsheet with lat lon columns, and asks you for the radius.

As explained below, you can get the latitudes and longitudes of EPA-regulated facilities if you want to specify a set of facilities by uploading their Registry ID numbers in a table, or using other identifiers. For example, there is a function `latlon_from_programid()` in the examples below.

You can also get coordinates in a few other ways, such as by NAICS (or SIC) industry names or codes, EPA program covering the set of facilities (e.g., all greenhouse gas reporters), or a Clean Air Act MACT subpart.

## Facilities by ID

EPA-regulated facilities can be found in the Facility Registry Services by identification number.

### by Facility, using EPA Registry ID

```{r frs_from_regid1, eval = FALSE}
# note frs_from_regid() and latlon_from_regid() require the frs dataset, which they try to load on demand.

frs_from_regid(c(110071293460, 110000333826))

## interactively upload file with table of REGISTRY_ID values
x <- latlon_from_regid(read_csv_or_xl()$REGISTRY_ID)

## and run through EJAM
y <- ejamit(latlon_from_regid(read_csv_or_xl()$REGISTRY_ID), radius = 1)
#  # still debugging Island Areas validation here!
```

### by Facility, using EPA Program System ID

```{r tryload_frs_by_programid, include=FALSE}
dataload_dynamic("frs_by_programid")
```

```{r latlon_from_programid, eval = TRUE}
# latlon_from_programid() requires access to the frs_by_programid dataset, which it tries to load on demand.

if (exists("frs_by_programid")) {
  latlon_from_programid(c("XJW000012435", "00768SRTRSROAD1"))
}
```

## Facilities by Type

### by Industry (NAICS) {data-link="by Industry (NAICS)"}

You can specify sites by NAICS, but it is important to note the FRS lacks NAICS info for many regulated facilities!

```{r naics_from_any, eval = TRUE} 
naics_from_any("paint and coating", children = T) 
## note latlon_from_naics() requires the frs_by_naics dataset, which it tries to load on demand. 
# head(latlon_from_naics(325510)) 
# has about 1,000 facilities  
#
# All sectors with this phrase in their NAICS title
# 
#  x <- ejamit(frs_from_naics("paint and coating"), 1)}
```

See many more examples of [Working with NAICS Codes (Industry Codes)], in a section below.

### by EPA Regulatory Program

```{r tryload_frs_AND_frs_by_programid, include=FALSE}
dataload_dynamic("frs_by_programid")
dataload_dynamic("frs")
```

```{r latlon_from_program, eval = TRUE}
# note latlon_from_programid() requires the frs and frs_by_programid datasets, which it tries to load on demand.
if (exists("frs_by_programid") && exists("frs")) {
  
  ## Map of over 10,000 facilities in FRS identified as in the E-Grid power plant database
  
  pts <- latlon_from_program("EGRID")[, 1:4]
  mapfast(pts)
  
  ## In just 1 State
  pts[, ST := state_from_latlon(lat = lat, lon = lon)$ST]
  mapfast(pts[ST == "TX", ], radius = 1)

  ## Largest lists
  
  epa_programs_counts <- frs_by_programid[, .N, by = "program"][order(N), ]
  epa_programs_counts[order(-N), ][1:25, ]
}
```

### by MACT Subpart (hazardous air pollutant source category)

```{r tryload_frs_by_mact, include=FALSE}
dataload_dynamic("frs_by_mact")
```

```{r latlon_from_mactsubpart, eval = TRUE}
# note latlon_from_mactsubpart() requires the frs_by_mact dataset, which it tries to load on demand
if (exists("frs_by_mact")) {
  
  # Search by name of category
  mact_table[grepl("ethylene", mact_table$title, ignore.case = T), ]
  eto <- rbind(
    latlon_from_mactsubpart("O" ), 
    latlon_from_mactsubpart("WWWWW")
  )
  #  Map the category
  mapfast(eto)
  
  
  # Browse the full list of categories
  # mact_table[ , c("N", "subpart", "title")]
  
  # The 10 largest categories
  tail(mact_table[order(mact_table$N), c("N", "subpart", "title")], 10)
  
  # Many facilities lack latitude longitude information in this database
  nrow(latlon_from_mactsubpart("A", include_if_no_latlon = TRUE))
  nrow(latlon_from_mactsubpart("A", include_if_no_latlon = FALSE))
  
  head(latlon_from_mactsubpart("OOOO"), 2)
}
```

## Working with NAICS Codes (Industry Codes)

### NAICS Codes to Map or Analyze Facilities in one Industrial Sector

Overview of NAICS / industry categories, at n-digit level
```{r naics_more}
# see NAICS categories at the top (2-digit) level

naics_categories()

# see NAICS categories at the 3-digit level

  # sorted alphabetical
naics_from_any(naics_categories(3))[order(name),.(name,code)][1:10,]
  # sorted by code
naics_from_any(naics_categories(3))[order(code),.(code,name)][1:10,]

```

Find NAICS codes, from the name of an industry
```{r naics_code_from_name}
naics_from_any('paint')
```

Find industry names, from the NAICS codes
```{r naics_namefromcode}
# get name from one code
naics_from_code(336)$name

# get the name from each code
naics_from_code(mycode)$name
```

Count facilities by NAICS code
```{r naics_counts_by_code}
mycode = c(33611, 336111, 336112)

# see counts of facilities by code (parent) and subcategories (children)
naics_counts[NAICS %in% mycode, ]

# see parent codes that contain each code
naicstable[code %in% mycode, ]
```

Find facilities, by name of industry
```{r pulpindustry, eval = TRUE}

# See a data table of facilities in one industry
dataload_dynamic("frs")
if (exists("frs")) {
industryword <- "pulp"

head( frs_from_naics(naics_from_any(industryword)$code)[,1:4] )
}
```

Quick map of EPA-regulated facilities in one industrial category, which you can click on to see popup windows about sites.
```{r mapfast(frs_from_naics), eval = TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
# note frs_from_naics() requires the frs dataset, which it tries to load on demand.
dataload_dynamic("frs")
if (exists("frs")) {
mapfast(frs_from_naics("smelt")) # may be slow the 1st time, if it loads frs dataset
}
```

(but note that this FRS dataset lacks NAICS for most facilities!)

Table of facilities in an industry, plus links to each facility in ECHO and EJScreen
```{r frs_from_naics-chemicalmanuf, eval = FALSE}
industryword <- "chemical manuf"
#  industryword <- "smelt"
if (exists("frs")) {
mysites <- frs_from_naics(industryword, children = FALSE)[,1:5]

regids <- mysites$REGISTRY_ID
link1 <- url_echo_facility_webpage(regids, as_html = T)
link2 <- url_ejscreen_report(lat = mysites$lat, lon = mysites$lon, radius = 3, as_html = T)
link3 <- url_ejscreenmap(lat = mysites$lat, lon = mysites$lon,  as_html = T)
# # same:
# my_industry <- naics_from_any("chemical manuf",children = F)[,.(code,name)]
# mysites <- frs_from_naics(my_industry$code)[,1:5]
mysites <- cbind(`ECHO report` = link1, 
                 `EJScreen Report` = link2, `EJScreen Map` = link3,
                 mysites)
caption = paste0(nrow(mysites), ' sites have NAICS matching "', industryword, '"')
if (nrow(mysites) > 1500) {mysites <- mysites[1:1500, ]} # >2k rows is too much for client-side DataTables
cat(caption,'\n')

print(
  DT::datatable(
    mysites[1:5, ],
    escape = FALSE,     rownames = FALSE,
    caption = caption,
    filter = "top"
  )
)
}
```

Map of facilities in an industry, plus popups with links to each facility in ECHO and EJScreen
```{r map2, eval = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
mapfast(mysites)
```

Facilities searches using industry codes or text in industry names

```{r plastics-and-rubber, eval = TRUE}
naics_from_any("plastics and rubber") 

naics_from_any(326)

head(naics_from_any(326, children = T)[,.(code,name)])

naics_from_any("pig") 
naics_from_any("pig ") # space after g

# a OR b,  a AND b,  etc.
a = naics_from_any("plastics")

b = naics_from_any("rubber")

library(data.table)
data.table::fintersect(a,b)[,.(name,code)] #  a AND b

head(data.table::funion(a,b)[,.(name,code)])     #  a OR  b

# naics_subcodes_from_code(funion(a,b)[,code])[,.(name,code)]   #  plus children

head(naics_from_any(funion(a,b)[,code], children = T)[,.(name,code)] ) #  same
```

A NAICS code can have many "children" or subcategories under it

```{r frs_from_naics-details, eval = TRUE}
dataload_dynamic(c("frs", "frs_by_naics"))
if (exists("frs") & exists("frs_from_naics")) {

NROW(naics_from_any("chem"))
# about 20
NROW(naics_from_any("chem", children = T))
# >100
NROW(frs_from_naics(naics_from_any("chem")$code))
# a few thousand
NROW(frs_from_naics(naics_from_any("chem", children = T)$code))
# >10,000
}
```

# SHAPEFILES

### Polygons in shapefiles as the places to compare

You can upload polygons in a shapefile, and use EJAM to analyze them. See the Shiny app.

See shapefile_from_any() and related functions:

```{r notrun_shapefile_functionlist, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
shapefile_from_any()

shapefile_from_sitepoints()
shape_buffered_from_shapefile()
shape_buffered_from_shapefile_points()

shp1 <- shapefile_from_gdbzip(system.file("testdata/shapes/portland.gdb.zip", package = "EJAM"))

```

# FIPS CODES

### Counties as the places to compare

You can compare places defined by FIPS code, such as a group of US Counties.

Compare all Counties in a State, using EJAM indicators

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# NOTE THE EXAMPLES BELOW ARE VERY SLOW TO LOAD/RUN ! 
```

```{r counties_fips, eval = FALSE}

# Get FIPS of each county in Delaware
mystate <- "Delaware"
cfips <- fips_counties_from_statename(mystate)

## You could launch a web browser tab for each of the counties,
##  to see each of the County reports from EJScreen, like this:
#
# sapply(url_ejscreen_report(areaid = cfips), browseURL)

## Analyze EJ stats for each county in the State

x <- ejamit(fips = cfips) # radius not used
DT::datatable(x$results_bysite, escape = F)

ejam2table_tall(x)

t(x$results_bysite[ , c(
  'ejam_uniq_id', 'pop', names_d_subgroups_ratio_to_state_avg), with = F])

mapfastej_counties(x$results_bysite)

cnames <- fips2countyname(x$results_bysite$ejam_uniq_id)
#cnames <- c("Kent County", "New Castle County", "Sussex County")
#cnames <- gsub(" County", "", cnames)

barplot(x$results_bysite$pctlowinc, names.arg = cnames,
        main = paste0('% Low Income by County in ', mystate))

# Another example
mystate <- "Maryland"
vname <- "% low income"
xmd <- ejamit(fips = fips_counties_from_statename(mystate))
ggblanket::gg_col(data = xmd$results_bysite,
                  y = pctlowinc,
                  x = ejam_uniq_id,
                  title = paste0(vname, ' by County in ', mystate),
                  y_title = vname
)

mapfastej_counties(xmd$results_bysite, 'state.pctile.pctlowinc')

```

# EXPLORING RESULTS

### The most striking findings (e.g., which group is most overrepresented?)

See examples above using ejam2report() but also you can check some key findings like this:

```{r count_sites_with_n_high, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
x <- testoutput_ejamit_1000pts_1miles 
out <- x$results_bysite
out <- setDF(copy(out))
ratio_benchmarks <- c(1.01, 1.50, 2, 3, 5, 10)
ratiodata <- out[, names_d_ratio_to_state_avg]

findings <- count_sites_with_n_high_scores(ratiodata, quiet = TRUE)  # long output to console !

tail(findings$text[findings$text != ""], 1) # the most extreme finding!

```

### The key facilities (e.g., which has the max of -- or has multiple elevated -- Summary Indexes?)

```{r topsites}
out2 <- ejamit(
  sitepoints =  testpoints_100,
  radius = 3.1
)
x <- out2$results_summarized$cols
x <- x[order(x[,1], decreasing = T), ]
head(x, 3)
cat("\n")
x <- x[order(x[,2], decreasing = T), ]
head(x, 3)
```

### More summary findings

```{r count_sites_etc_more, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
dimnames(findings)
findings$text[2]
head(findings$stats[ , , 1], 15)
head(findings$stats[ , 1, ], 21)
x = findings$stats[ , 1, ] 
x[x[, "cum_pct"] >= 50 & x[, "cum_pct"] <= 80, ]
findings$stats[ 1, , ]
```

## Site by site detailed results in datatable format in RStudio viewer:

```{r datatable30}
out2 <- testoutput_ejamit_100pts_1miles
DT::datatable(out2$results_bysite[1:5,   ], escape = FALSE, rownames = FALSE)

# To see all 1,000 sites in table:
#DT::datatable(out2$results_bysite[1:1000, ], escape = FALSE, rownames = FALSE)
```

### Overall results for a few key indicators, as raw output in console:

```{r cbind-overall, eval = TRUE, paged.print= TRUE}
out2 <- testoutput_ejamit_100pts_1miles

names(out2)
cbind(overall = as.list( out2$results_overall[ , ..names_d]))
cbind(overall = as.list( out2$results_overall[ , ..names_d_subgroups]))
```

### Overall results for the very long list of all indicators, as raw output in console:

```{r}
out2 <- testoutput_ejamit_100pts_1miles

head(
  ejam2table_tall(out2)
  , 20)
# head(
#   cbind(as.list(out2$results_overall))
#   , 12)
```

## Just one site, all the indicators

```{r ejam2table_tall_1}
head(
  ejam2table_tall(out2, sitenumber = 1)
  , 20)
```

#### See indicators aggregated over all people across all sites

```{r cbindagain, eval = TRUE}
## view output of batch run aggregation ####
out <- testoutput_ejamit_1000pts_1miles
head(cbind(overall = as.list( out$results_overall)))

## To see just some subset of indicators, like Environmental only:
cbind(overall = as.list( out$results_overall[ , ..names_e])); cat("\n")
cbind(overall = as.list( out$results_overall[ , ..names_d])); cat("\n")
cbind(overall = as.list( out$results_overall[ , ..names_d_subgroups])); cat("\n")
cbind(overall = as.list( out$results_overall[ , ..names_e_pctile])); cat("\n")
cbind(overall = as.list( out$results_overall[ , ..names_d_pctile])); cat("\n")
# cbind(overall = as.list( out$results_overall[ , ..names_ej_pctile])); cat("\n")
```

# VISUALIZATION OF FINDINGS (PLOTS)

## Indicators

### Barplot showing which indicator is most elevated overall

```{r barplot_d, eval=TRUE}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   Barplot of ratios of residential population indicators at selected sites to State averages. 
#|   It is a series of bars where some are above a ratio of 1, and one is more than 2
#|   times the State average of supplemental demog. index.
out <- testoutput_ejamit_1000pts_1miles

ejam2barplot(out,
  varnames = c(names_d_ratio_to_state_avg, names_d_subgroups_ratio_to_state_avg),
  main = "Residential population group percentages at Selected Sites Compared to State Averages")
```

### Histogram of indicators distribution over all people across all sites

```{r histo, eval = TRUE}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   Histogram of distribution of scores nearby, in ten decile bins, as percentiles versus a
#|   flat line representing the US overall, an expected count of 100 sites per decile,
#|   out of 1,000 sites total. 
#|   Bars in the first three deciles (low traffic scores) are above the expected 100 line,
#|   meaning these sites have an overrepresentation of sites with low traffic scores
#|   compared to the US overall.
hist(out$results_bysite$pctile.traffic.score, 10, xlab = "Local traffic scores (expressed as a percentile)", 
     ylab = "count of sites in each bin, out of 1,000 sites", freq = TRUE, 
     main = "Actual distribution of scores nearby, as percentiles, 
     vs flat line = USA overall")
abline(h = nrow(out$results_bysite)/10)
```
