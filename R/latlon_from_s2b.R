#' DRAFT - Estimate lat,lon of site(s) from sites2blocks output of getblocksnearby()
#' trilateration -- Use lat,lon of nearby block points and distances to estimate original sitepoints
#' @details
#' This function is needed ONLY if you did not retain site latlons,
#'  and then only for sites not entirely in single states based on their nearby blocks.
#' This is slow and assumes you do not already know the lat,lon of the sitepoints.
#' If for some reason all you have is output of [getblocksnearby()] then this is how you could 
#' estimate where the original sitepoint(s) were that were input(s) to [getblocksnearby()]
#' 
#' But ejamit() or the shiny app do not require doing this since the original latlon
#' of sitepoints are retained and provided to [doaggregate()]
#' which needs to figure out what state each site is in to use the right state percentiles.
#' 
#' @param s2b sites2blocks data.table that is output of [getblocksnearby()]
#'
#' @return data.table with columns ejam_uniq_id, lat, lon, one row per site
#' @examples
#'  pts = testpoints_10
#'  #x = latlon_from_s2b(getblocksnearby(pts, quiet = T))
#'  x = latlon_from_s2b(testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles)
#'  cbind(estimate = x, pts, 
#'    latratio = x$lat/pts$lat, lonratio = x$lon/pts$lon)
