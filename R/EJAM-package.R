#' @description
#' EJAM provides a way to run hundreds or thousands of location-specific reports all at once, very quickly.
#' It is also an R package, with functions and data for very fast analysis of areas defined by
#' proximity to points like regulated facilities, areas defined as shapefiles/polygons,
#' or areas specified as Census units (e.g., Counties).
#' 
#' @details  # **What is EJAM and How to do Analysis with the EJAM R Package** ###################
#'
#' [EJAM package documentation](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/index.html) provides
#' an overview of EJAM, a complete reference document on all functions, and
#' articles (vignettes) introducing key functions and how to use them.

#'   EJAM.
#'   
#'   Each year, EJAM should updated to use newer residential population and environmental data,
#'   and some indicators may be added, dropped, or revised during those updates. 
#'   For details on these updates and changes to datasets and indicators,
