#'   
#'   blockwts is a table of all census blocks, with the weights reflecting
#'   what fraction of the parent block group census 2020 population lived in
#'   that block.  The weights are used to aggregate block-level data to blockgroup,
#'   for cases where only some of the blockgroup is in a circular buffer or polygon.
#'   
#'   It also has a column
#'   called `blockid` that can join it to other block datasets.
