#' Create localtree (a quadtree index of all US block centroids) in global environment
#' 
#' @details Note this is duplicated code in .onAttach() and also in global.R  
#' 
#'    .onAttach() can be edited to create this when the package loads, 
#'   but then it takes time each time a developer rebuilds/installs the package or others that load EJAM.
#'   
#' It also has to happen in global.R if it has not already.
#' @return Returns TRUE when done. Side effect is it creates the index in memory.
#' 
#' @export
