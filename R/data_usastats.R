#' @description data.frame of 100 percentiles and means (about 100 rows)
#'   in the USA overall, across all locations (e.g., block groups in [blockgroupstats])
#'   for a set of indicators such as percent low income.
#'   Each column is one indicator (or specifies the percentile).
#'   
#'   This should be similar to the lookup tables in the gdb on the FTP site of EJScreen,
#'   except it also has data for additional population subgroups.
#'
