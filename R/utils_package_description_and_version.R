## NOTES ON CONSOLIDATING AND CLARIFYING CODE THAT 
## CHECKS METADATA LIKE THE PACKAGE VERSION NUMBER AND ACS DATA VERSION
## FROM THE INSTALLED VERSION OF THE EJAM PACKAGE, AND/OR FROM THE CURRENT LOCAL SOURCE PACKAGE VERSION
## see global find of "desc::desc"
######################################################## #



### The function below MAY NOT BE NEEDED -- THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO GET THIS INFO - SEE NOTES BELOW

# one way is the EJAM:::description_file  object created by metadata_mapping.R when pkg is attached.
# That is the same as package_description() created below, unless you need the non-installed, local source version the function below can provide.

# e.g., simplest ways to get installed package version or acs version:
# EJAM:::description_file$get("Version")
# EJAM:::description_file$get("ACSVersion")



## EXAMPLE/DRAFT OF A FUNCTION THAT COULD REPLACE CODE WHERE desc::desc is used or description_file is used



# package_description <- function() {
# 
#   ## also see, as alternative to desc::desc(), packageDescription("EJAM")
#   ## as a way that uses the loaded or attached version,
#   ##    via getNamespaceInfo("EJAM", "path") if it is loaded already,
#   ##    or attr(as.environment("package:EJAM"), "path") if it is already on search() path
#   ## but then otherwise falls back on the installed version, even if you are in the working dir that is the root of the source pkg.
#   # packageDescription("EJAM")
# 
#   # EJAM:::description_file created by metadata_mapping.R
#   ## will already contain the info based on when the pkg was last installed,
#   ## unless you have just used load_all() in which case it should have the current source version?
#   ## e.g.,
#   # EJAM:::description_file$get("Version")
# 
#   # This first checks the current source version in the current working directory, not necessarily the same as the version installed
#   desc <- try(desc::desc(file = "DESCRIPTION"))
# 
#   # if not found, this then checks for an INSTALLED version (or maybe any version loaded via load_all() ?? )
#   if (inherits(desc, 'try-error')) {desc <- try(desc::desc(package = "EJAM"))}
# 
#   # if still not found, this also checks for an INSTALLED version (or maybe any version loaded via load_all() ?? )
#   if (inherits(desc, 'try-error')) {desc <- desc::desc(file = app_sys('DESCRIPTION'))}
# 
#   # this if done on the fly will look in current working dir
#   # description_file <- desc::description$new("DESCRIPTION")
# 
#   if (inherits(desc, 'try-error')) {
#     warning('cannot find DESCRIPTION file in working directory or in EJAM package')
#     desc <- NULL
#   }
#   return(desc)
