#' get ratios of each site's scores to US means (using output of batch buffering)
#' 
#' Used to create input to [boxplots_ratios()] and can be used elsewhere now
#' 
#' @details  Note that colnames returned are same as input, not renamed to say "ratio"
#'   If names_d_subgroups are included, those means are not in API output from EJScreen
#'   so it gets the means from usastats or statestats
#' @param out data.frame output from [ejscreenapi_plus()] or from [ejscreenapi()] or doaggregate(),
#'   one row per buffer or site, and 
#'   columns for indicators named in evarnames, dvarnames, avg.evarnames, avg.dvarnames
#' @param evarnames vector of variable names for environmental indicators in out, like pm, o3, etc.
#' @param dvarnames vector of variable names for residential population indicators in out, such as pctlowinc
#' @param zone.prefix us or state, must fit with colnames in out such as  avg.pctlowinc and state.avg.pctlowinc
#' @param avg.evarnames use only if user-specific variable names are in out, 
#'   with defaults like avg.pm
#' @param avg.dvarnames use only if user-specific variable names are in out, 
#'   with defaults like  avg.pctlowinc
#'
#' @return a list with ratios_d and ratios_e which are 
#'   vectors of numbers the lengths of dvarnames and evarnames
#'
#' @examples
#'  out <- testoutput_ejscreenit_5$table # has long names

#'  out2 <- testoutput_ejscreenapi_plus_5 # has r names already
