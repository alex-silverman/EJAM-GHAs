#' DRAFT / WAS WORK IN PROGRESS  Find nearby blocks using Quad Tree data structure for speed
#'
#' @description Given a set of points and a specified radius (in miles),
#'   this function quickly finds all the US Census blocks near each point.
#'   For each point, it uses the specified search radius and finds the distance to
#'   every block within the circle defined by the radius.
#'   Each block is defined by its Census-provided internal point, by latitude and longitude.
#'
#'
#'
#'
#'
#'   Each point can be the location of a regulated facility or other type of site, and
#'   the blocks are a high-resolution source of information about where
#'   residents live.
#'
#'   Finding which blocks have their internal points in a circle provides
#'   a way to quickly estimate what fraction of a block group is
#'   inside the circular buffer more accurately and more quickly than
#'   areal apportionment of block groups would provide.
#'
#' @param sitepoints data.table with columns ejam_uniq_id, lat, lon giving point locations of sites or facilities around which are circular buffers
#' @param radius in miles, defining circular buffer around site point
#' @param maxradius miles distance (max distance to check if not even 1 block point is within radius)
#' @param avoidorphans logical Whether to avoid case where no block points are within radius,
#'   so if TRUE, it keeps looking past radius to find nearest one within maxradius.
#' @param quadtree (a pointer to the large quadtree object)
#'    created from the SearchTree package example:
#'    SearchTrees::createTree( quaddata, treeType = "quad", dataType = "point")
#'    Takes about 2-5 seconds to create this each time it is needed.
#'    It is automatically created when the package is attached via the .onAttach() function
#' @param report_progress_every_n Reports progress to console after every n points,
#'   mostly for testing, but a progress bar feature might be useful unless this is super fast.
