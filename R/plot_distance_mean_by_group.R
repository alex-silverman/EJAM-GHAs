#' Barplot of Average Proximity, by Group
#'
#' Shows distance to sites, for residents in each population group (vs everyone else).
#'   plot_distance_mean_by_group() and plot_distance_by_group() are synonymous.
#'
#' @details Note that the ratio shown is a ratio of distance among others to distance of a given group,
#'   so values below 1 mean the given group lives closer to facilities.
#'   A value of 0.85 would mean the group is only 85% as far from a site as everyone else.
#'
#'   Note it is in miles assuming input was in miles, and the distance for each resident is
#'    actually the average distance of all residents within their Census block (not block group),
#'    and when a site is very close to the block internal point (like a centroid)
#'    relative to the size of the block, the distance to the average resident in the block is
#'    estimated as 90 percent of the effective radius, which is what the radius of the block
#'    would be if it were the same area in square meters or miles but circular in shape.
#'
#'    This is the approach used in EJScreen to estimate average proximity of a block resident in
#'    cases where the block is extremely close to the site or the site may actually be inside the block,
#'    or exactly on top of the internal point of the block, in which case zero would not be an
#'    appropriate estimate of the distance, hence this adjustment is made in EJAM [getblocksnearby()]

#'  Note on Avg Distance and range of distances in each Demog group, & %D as function of distance:
#'
#'  We have info on each blockgroup near each site, which means some small % of those bgs are duplicated in this table:
#'
#'     results_bybg_people
#'
#'  Mostly we want overall (not by site) to know avg and cum distrib of distances in each demog,
#'
#'  (and also %D as a function of continuous distance),
#'
#'  and for those stats we would want to take only unique blockgroups from here,
#'  using the shorter distance, so the distribution of distances does not doublecount people.
#'
#' But we might also want to see that distribution of distances by D for just 1 site?
