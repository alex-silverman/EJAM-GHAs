#' Find all blocks within each of the FIPS codes provided
#' 
#' Allows EJAM to analyze and compare Counties, for example
#' 
#' @param fips vector of FIPS codes identifying blockgroups, tracts, counties, or states.
#'   This is useful if -- instead of gettings stats on and comparing circular buffers or polygons --
#'    one will be getting stats on one or more tracts, 
#'   or analyzing and comparing blockgroups in a county, 
#'   or comparing whole counties to each other, within a State.
#' @param inshiny used by shiny app server code to handle errors via validate() instead of stop()
#' @param need_blockwt set to FALSE to speed it up if you do not need blockwt
#' @return same as for [getblocksnearby] but one row per FIPS, and the distance column is irrelevant
