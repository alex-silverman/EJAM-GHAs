#' Find all Census blocks in a polygon, using internal point of block
#'
#' @description Like [getblocksnearby()], but for blocks in each polygon rather than
#' blocks near each facility. For analyzing all residents in certain zones
#' such as places at elevated risk, redlined areas, watersheds, etc.
#'
#'
#' @aliases shapefile2blockpoints
#'
#' @details This uses getblocksnearby() to get a very fast rough/good estimate of
#'   which US block points are nearby (with a safety margin - see param below),
#'   before then using sf:: to carefully identify which of those candidate blocks are actually
#'   inside each polygon (e.g., circle) according to sf:: methods.
#'
#'   For circular buffers, just using getblocksnearby() should work and not need this function.
#'
#'   For noncircular polygons, buffered or not, this function will provide a way to very quickly
#'   filter down to which of the millions of US blocks should be examined by the sf:: join / intersect,
#'   since otherwise it takes forever for sf:: to check all US blocks.
#' @param polys Spatial data as from sf::st_as_sf(), with
#'   points as from [shapefile_from_sitepoints()],
#'   or a table of points with lat,lon columns that will first be converted here using that function,
#'   or polygons
#' @param addedbuffermiles width of optional buffering to add to the points (or edges), in miles
#' @param blocksnearby optional table of blocks with blockid, etc (from which lat,lon can be looked up in blockpoints dt)
#' @param dissolved If TRUE, use sf::st_union(polys) to find unique blocks inside any one or more of polys
#' @param safety_margin_ratio multiplied by addedbuffermiles, how far to search for
#'   blocks nearby using getblocksnearby(), before using those found to do the intersection via sf::
#' @param crs used in st_as_sf() and st_transform() and shape_buffered_from_shapefile_points(), crs = 4269 or Geodetic CRS NAD83
#' @param updateProgress optional Shiny progress bar to update
#' @return Block points table for those blocks whose internal point is inside the buffer
#'   which is just a circular buffer of specified radius if polys are just points.
