#' helper function to rename variables that are colnames of data.frame
#' 
#' Changes variable names like colnames to long plain-English headers or short labels for plots
#' 
#' @details You specify an alias of a type like "api", "r", "long", or "short",
#'   or one of `colnames(map_headernames)` like "rname", "vartype", "decimals", "varlist", etc.
#'   
#'   Also, you can use this to extract any info from `map_headernames` (which 
#'   here is called mapping_for_names).
#'   
#'   NOTE: if you ask to rename your words to a known type like rname or apiname, and 
#'   the namesnow is not found among the oldtype, then it is not renamed, and those are returned as unchanged.
#'   BUT, if you specify as newtype some column that is not a known type of name, like "varcategory" 
#'   then it will instead return an empty string for those in namesnow that are not found among the oldtype.
#'   That way if you are really seeking a new name, but it cannot rename, it keeps the old name
#'   while if you are really seeking metadata like what category it is in, 
#'   it returns a blank if the old name is not found at all.
#'  
#'   These are some key column names in the [map_headernames] table:
#'    
#'   - "shortname" (aka "short", for plot labels, etc.)
#'   
#'   - "longname" (aka "long", for full explanatory headers to use on a table)
#'   
#'   - "rname" (aka "r", the R variable names as used in the EJAM code)
#'   
#'   - "apiname" (aka "api", as returned by EJScreen API)
#'   
#'   - "csvname" (aka "csv", as found in the CSV files of just the key residential population and environmental indicators, found on the EJScreen FTP site)
#'   
#'   - "acsname" (aka "acs", as found in a ACS data file internally used by EJScreen, containing all the extra residential population groups and other indicators not stored in the CSV files on the EJScreen FTP site)
#'   
#'   - "DEJ" (whether the indicator is residential population, environmental, etc.)
#'   
#'   - "varlist" (which group of names is this variable in, such as "names_d", "names_d_subgroups", "names_d_state_pctile", etc.)
#'   
#'   - "calculation_type" (how it should be aggregated over block groups, such as "wtdmean", "sum of counts", etc.)
#'   
#'   - "denominator" (the weight to use in aggregating as a wtdmean, normally a count variable that is the universe for a percentage, such as "pop", "hhlds", etc.)
#'   
#' @param namesnow vector of colnames to be renamed
#' @param oldtype "longname" or "shortname", or "csv" or "r" or "api", etc.
#'   or a colname of map_headernames, used if one of those known types was not specified.
#' @param newtype "longname" or "shortname", or "csv" or "r" or "api", etc.
#'   or a colname of map_headernames, used if one of those known types was not specified.
#' @param mapping_for_names default is a dataset already in the package.
