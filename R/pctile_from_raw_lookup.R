#' Find approx percentiles in lookup table that is in memory
#'
#' @description This is used with a lookup table to
#'   convert a raw indicator vector to percentiles in US or States.
#' @details
#'
#'   This could be recoded to be more efficient - could use data.table.
#'
#'
#'   The data.frame lookup table must have a field called "PCTILE" that has quantiles/percentiles
#'   and other column(s) with values that fall at those percentiles.
#'   [usastats] and [statestats] are such lookup tables.
#'   This function uses a lookup table and
#'   finds the number in the PCTILE column that corresponds to where a specified value
#'   (in myvector) appears in the column called varname.in.lookup.table.
#'   The function just looks for where the specified value fits between values in the lookup table
#'    and returns the approximate percentile as found in the PCTILE column.
#'   If the value is between the cutpoints listed as
#'   percentiles 89 and 90, it returns 89, for example.
#'   If the value is exactly equal to the cutpoint listed as percentile 90,
#'   it returns percentile 90.
#'   If the value is exactly the same as the minimum in the lookup table and multiple percentiles
#'   in that lookup are listed as tied for having the same threshold value defining the percentile
#'    (i.e., a large percent of places have the same score and it is the minimum score),
#'    then the percentile gets reported as 0,
#'   not the percent of places tied for that minimum score. Note this is true whether they are
#'   tied at a value of 0 or are tied at some other minimum value than 0.
#'   If the value is less than the cutpoint listed as percentile 0,
#'   which should be the minimum value in the dataset,
#'   it still returns 0 as the percentile, but with a warning that
#'   the value checked was less than the minimum in the dataset.
#'
#'   It also handles other odd cases, like where a large percent of all raw scores are tied at
#'   the minimum value, in which case it reports 0 as percentile, not that large percent.
#'
#' @param myvector Numeric vector, required. Values to look for in the lookup table.
#' @param varname.in.lookup.table Character element, required.
#'   Name of column in lookup table to look in
#'   to find interval where a given element of myvector values is.
#'
#'   *** If vector is provided, then must be same length as myvector,
#'
#'   but only 1 value for zone can be provided.
#'
#' @param lookup Either lookup must be provided, not quoted,
#'   or a lookup table called [usastats] must already be in memory. This is the lookup table
#'   data.frame with a PCTILE column, REGION column, and column whose name is the value of varname.in.lookup.table
#'   To use state lookups set lookup=statestats
#' @param zone Character element (or vector as long as myvector), optional.
#'   If specified, must appear in a column called REGION within the lookup table,
#'    or NA returned for each item looked up and warning given.
#'   For example, it could be "NY" for New York State, "USA" for national percentiles.
#' @param quiet set to FALSE to see details on where certain scores were all NA values like in 1 state
#' @aliases lookup_pctile
#' @return By default, returns numeric vector length of myvector.
#' @examples \donttest{

  ## notes on findInterval ####
  #
  # findInterval returns the gap (interval) number, 0 through length(myvector), and
  # 0 if < min of lookup, and counts it as in the gap if tied with lower edge and less than upper edge.
  # If lookup was for pctiles 1-100, the whichinterval would be the same as the percentile, including for findInterval = pctile = 0.
  # The lookup table has pctiles 0-100, where 0 is min and 0-1 is 1st 1%, so
  # the pctile should be reported as lookup[whichinterval, varname.in.lookup.table] ....
  #  unless whichinterval = 0 (i.e., place has score smaller than min of all places used in creating the lookup table) in which case report 0 for pctile.

  # ***   fix case where multiple percentiles are tied in lookup table... as with pctlingiso
  # findInterval will return the last interval, not the first, that it matches when there are duplicates,
  # which does not mesh with how the lookup table should be interpreted.
  # -- We want to report the first not last when the same value is shown as being at multiple percentiles,
  # which happens if a large percent of places are tied at some given value, such as when 30% of places have a score of zero, e.g.
  # One workaround is to check the lookup tables for cases of ties at min value, and add a very tiny amount to each of those,
  #  which will force it to report 0 percentile for that value that hasn't had the tiny amount added.
  # that seems like an awkward hack but would work.
  # We could alter the statestats table itself, and usastats. but,
  # solution: created   high_pctiles_tied_with_min  dataset
  # Rule for using it here:
  # if reported pctile per lookup function is <= these high_pctiles_tied_with_min,
  # then report instead zero as the percentile.
  #
  # To see what variables in what states have a bunch of tied values at minimum that is NOT zero, and then ties at zero:
  # datacols <- setdiff(names(statestats), c('PCTILE', 'REGION')); states <- unique(statestats$REGION);  for (myvar in datacols) {for (mystate in states) {z = statestats[mystate == statestats$REGION, myvar]
  #   if ((z[1] == z[2]) & (z[1] != 0)) {cat("in ",mystate, " for ", myvar, " = ", z[1], '\n')}}}
  # datacols <- setdiff(names(statestats), c('PCTILE', 'REGION')); states <- unique(statestats$REGION);  for (myvar in datacols) {for (mystate in states) {z = statestats[mystate == statestats$REGION, myvar]
  #   if ((z[1] == z[2]) & (z[1] == 0)) {cat("in ",mystate, " for ", myvar, " = ", z[1], '\n')}}}
  # datacols <- setdiff(names(usastats), c('PCTILE', 'REGION')); states <- unique(usastats$REGION);  for (myvar in datacols) {for (mystate in states) {z = statestats[mystate == usastats$REGION, myvar]
  #   if ((z[1] == z[2]) & (z[1] != 0)) {cat("in ",mystate, " for ", myvar, " = ", z[1], '\n')}}}
  # datacols <- setdiff(names(usastats), c('PCTILE', 'REGION')); states <- unique(usastats$REGION);  for (myvar in datacols) {for (mystate in states) {z = statestats[mystate == usastats$REGION, myvar]
  #   if ((z[1] == z[2]) & (z[1] == 0)) {cat("in ",mystate, " for ", myvar, " = ", z[1], '\n')}}}

  ## also, this probably happens for any set of tied threshold values (not only ties at min value) - but would need to confirm EJScreen was coded that way.

  # ** also using data.table might make this whole function significantly faster if statestats is a data.frame with keys REGION and PCTILE
  # pctile <- lookup[myvector >= ..varname.in.lookup.table, PCTILE[1]] # but also, if none where >= true, pctile <- lookup$PCTILE[1]
