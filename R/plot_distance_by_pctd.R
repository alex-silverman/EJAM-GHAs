#' What percentage of this group's population lives less than X miles from a site? --- *** DRAFT - NEED TO RECHECK CALCULATIONS
#'
#' @description *** DRAFT - NEED TO RECHECK CALCULATIONS
#'   This plots the cumulative share of residents found within each distance,
#'   for a single population group.
#' @details Also see ejamit_compare_distances() for a plot  of several indicators at several distances!
#' 
#'   This function uses the distance of each Census block from the site in conjunction with
#'   the block group residential population data, to provide a relatively detailed picture of
#'   how far away residents in each group live. In contrast, the function
#'   [distance_cdf_by_group_plot()] is based on ejamit()$results_bybg_people,
#'   which provides only block group resolution information about distance.
#'
#' @param s2b output of [getblocksnearby()], or else can be
#'   a table of points with lat,lon columns and 1 row per point.
#'   If NULL (not provided as a parameter to the function),
#'   will prompt for a file to upload and use, if interactive() is TRUE, or else
#'   the function will just show an example using a random point.
#' @param sitenumber If used, one number that is the unique ID
#'   (the row number of original list of points) to look at in s2b.
#'   This should be the same as the value of s2b$ejam_uniq_id for
#'   the site to be analyzed.
#'   Will be able to omit or set to NULL to use overall aggregate of all sites.
#' 
#' @param score_colname colname in blockgroupstats for an indicator to be
#'   aggregated across blocks and blockgroups as a weighted mean
#' @param scorewts_colname colname in blockgroupstats -- like "pop" -- for the weight
#'   to use in aggregating the scores referred to by score_colname
#' @param score_label optional friendly label for the variable
#'   
#' @param radius optional radius to use as maximum analyzed or shown --
#'   if s2b was provided, this caps what is used and only shorter radii get shown
#'   (only relevant if s2b had radii larger than this radius parameter)
#'   and if s2b is not provided, interactively RStudio user is prompted
#'   to provide latlon file to analyze in getblocksnearby() and
#'   radius is used in that.
#' 
#' @return returns s2b but with more columns in it like wtdmean_within
#' @examples

#'  # very high within 1 mile but drops by 3 miles away
