#' 
#' Like [distance_by_group()] but for multiple sites - DRAFT FUNCTION
#' 
#' @details There are two aspects of proximity to consider when analyzing
#'   residential population groups within a certain fixed distance (radius) from a single
#'   facility point (or a whole set of facilities). These two ways of summarizing
#'   proximity are complementary: 
#'   
#'   1. Which groups tend to live nearby in the sense of being within the selected radius
#'   versus outside the radius? In other words, which groups are "overrepresented"
#'   within X miles of the site? This treats proximity as a yes/no, binomial
#'   question -- a resident is nearby or not. It would focus on whether someone is
#'   anywhere within 3 miles, say, and ignore the differences between
#'   being 1, 2, or 3 miles away.
#'   
#'   2. Among the residents within X miles of the site, which groups live especially close to the
#'   facility? This question recognizes proximity is a continuous variable, and
#'   focuses on the difference between 1 mile, 1.5 miles, etc. However, it only
#'   looks at residents within the X miles radius area analyzed, so it fails
#'   to recognize that some groups tend to live more than 3 miles away, for example.
#'   This perspective does not take into account which groups are overrepresented
#'   within the original total radius near a site.
#'   
#'   This function does the second of these two types of analysis. It reports,
#'   only among those anywhere inside the radius, which groups are closer to the site.
#'   
#'   In a specific location, for example, one group could be
#'   underrepresented within 3 miles, but those few who are in the group
#'   still might live right next to the facility in which case
#'   their average distance would be higher than that of any other group
#'   because this function only counts those within the radius analyzed. 
#'   
#'   In some other location, the opposite could occur -- if one group is 
#'   overrepresented within 3 miles, they still might all live in a community
#'   about 2.9 miles away from the site -- that would mean their distance from
#'   the site on average is greater (or their proximity score is lower)
#'   than other groups within 3 miles of the site.
