## example
# out <- ejamit_compare_types_of_places(testpoints_10[1:4, ], typeofsite = c("A", "B", "B", "C"))

### Note that it takes roughly the same amount of time to do the getblocksnearby() for all points at once
### versus doing it group by group, so it 
### would not be much more efficient to do that part of ejamit() all at once:
# system.time({x = list() ; ng = 10 ; for (i in 1:ng) x[[i]] = getblocksnearby(testpoints_1000[(1 + (i-1) * (1000/ng)):(i * (1000/ng)),])})
# system.time({x= getblocksnearby(testpoints_1000)})

  #  Revamp ejamit_compare_types_of_places()
  # 
  # We should do ejamit(sitepoints) once for the results_overall, results_bysite, results_bybg_people (ie bybgbysite),
  # and then to get only the results_bytype (ie by group of sites) separately in a streamlined way...
  # So the way to do all this could be the following:
  #  *** - modify ejamit() to use new params to ejamit(  groupby = )  -- seems like the best approach...
  #     that would as usual run getblocksnearby() only once, and call doaggregate() once, but 
  #     *** A) modify doaggregate() to use new params doaggregate( groupby = )
  #       it would do the usual summaries 
  #      PLUS (maybe call a new function that would..) 
  #       return a new "results_bytype" table .... that would   
  #       calculate a  results_overall  1-row table on each group (each site type),
  #       and assemble those as a special results_bytype table. 
  #       Where/ how to best fit that into doaggregate() ?
  #      AND modify  related functions like ejam2report, ejam2excel, other excel functions, and server/shiny
  #      to 1st just save and then be able to display the new by type info.
  # 
  #  ejam2report(sitenumber = ) works but would add also ejam2report(sitetype = x), rather than typenumber =x
  #     or B) a separate doaggregate_bygroup() that ONLY calculates and returns results_bytype
  #       (but NOT calculate or return a results_overall that ignores groups/types, etc.)
  # ### But, note it would be much more efficient if each group could be summarized based on just results_bysite 
  #  instead of needing to redo the getblocksnearby() and redo the join of blockgroupstats 
  #  and could simply use wtd mean or sum over sites in a group,
  #  ***which should be OK IF THOSE SITES DO NOT OVERLAP AT ALL WITHIN A GROUP !!*** Explore and confirm this.
  #  We could take note of which sites overlap any others in a new site-specific column created while aggregating sites2blocks,
  #  and for all the ones that do not overlap, aggregate by group from that 1 full results_bysite done once over the whole set of groups.
  #  and for the other ones that might overlap within a group, could you go back to using something like.... 
  #  results_bysite_bybg? since that tells you for each site what fraction of each bg to count.... 
  #  no, you need to go back to sites2blocks table!! 
  # The problem is still to count each person only once you have to know which blocks are near which site, 
  # for the blockgroups where parts of the bg are near one site and parts are near the other site.

  # ejamit_compare_types_of_places() as a 1st draft, for now,

  # and
  # calculates a  results_bytype  which has 1 row per type,

  # table actually containing "results_bytype", but named "results_overall"
  # But, then you have to do some things to prep output of ejamit_... for use in ejam2excel() 
  # since that expects  "results_overall" and "results_bysite" and "results_bybg_people"
