tool<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-environmental-and-residential-population-analysis-multisite-tool"></a>
</h2>
<p>The Environmental and Residential Population Analysis Multisite tool
(multisite tool) is a software toolkit. EJAM is what powers the
Multisite Tool web application. EJAM is also available as an open-source
software package for developers and analysts.</p>
<p>EJAM lets you easily and quickly see residential population and
environmental information aggregated within and across hundreds or
thousands of places, all at the same time.</p>
<p>Using EJAM is like running a community environmental/census data
report, but for hundreds or thousands of places, all at the same
time.</p>
<p>You can see a quick summary, explore interactive maps, tables, and
plots, and download a summary report or detailed spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Locations can be defined in a variety of ways, so EJAM can summarize
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conditions near any set of points</strong><br>
(e.g., proximity analysis of residents near all the EPA-regulated
facilities of a certain type). This can provide information about people
who live in communities potentially affected by any of the industrial
facilities on a list, for example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditions within any areas you have defined on a
map</strong><br>
(e.g., if you have a shapefile of polygons/ zones based on measured or
modeled exposure or risk, or cities/neighborhoods, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="epa-data-methods">EPA Data &amp; Methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#epa-data-methods"></a>
</h3>
<p>EJAM begins with residential population and environmental data and
indicators. The default indicators are the ones used in EJScreen. It
uses the same methods as EJScreen but in a way that is optimized for
working with many locations at once.</p>
<p>The tool runs either a polygon-based or proximity-based analysis at
each location, just like EJScreen would provide a standard report for a
single location, except EJAM does this for each of a large number of
locations very quickly.</p>

<h3 id="new-unique-features">New &amp; Unique Features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#new-unique-features"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Summarizing Across Locations</strong></p>
<p>EJAM can calculate an aggregated summary of overall environmental
conditions and residential population percentages for the average
resident’s location, across all the populations and all of the
locations.</p>
<p>The summary report lets you quickly and easily see which residential
population groups live near the selected facilities or within defined
areas. It also provides new insights into which environmental stressors
may affect specific residential population subgroups to varying degrees,
near a regulated sector overall and at individual sites.</p>
<p>This allows easy geospatial analysis to move beyond looking at a
small number of indicators for a few residential population groups, at
one site in a single permitting decision, to a more complete picture of
conditions near a whole set of facilities that is the focus of a risk
analysis or a proposed action or initiative, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate Results (Speed)</strong></p>
<p>Compared to related GIS tools this new tool provides a ready-to-use
summary report, plus more flexibility, accuracy, and speed than other
tools have in the past. The website quickly provides results on the fly
– The software was optimized to be extremely fast (allowing realtime
exploratory work), while still using the same block-population
calculation EJScreen has been using, making it more consistent with how
EJScreen has always worked and more accurate than other approaches
(e.g., using “areal apportionment” of tracts or block groups, like some
other tools have used).</p>
<p><strong>Easy Ways to Specify the Places to Analyze</strong></p>
<p>The new tool also lets one pick locations through several different
approaches, such as - specifying facility points by industry categories
of various types (NAICS, SIC, EPA program, etc.) - providing a table of
point locations given as latitudes and longitudes - using shapefiles
with polygons (e.g., from the results of air quality modeling work) -
selecting Census units to compare, such as Counties.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Well-Documented Extensible Software</strong></p>
<p>Also, the data and software are shared as reusable, well-documented
functions in an R package, to allow software developers or analysts to
take advantage of these resources in running their own analyses or
building or supplementing their own tools, websites, or mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy and Spatial Resolution</strong></p>
<p>EJAM and EJScreen use the same approach to characterizing populations
at each site, to maintain consistency and avoid any confusion. Compared
to other often-used approaches, EJScreen/EJAM use high-resolution
buffering to provide more accurate information about which populations
live inside a buffer, which is important in rural areas where a single
blockgroup can cover a very large area. For circular buffers, the
internal points of Census 2020 blocks are used, not areal apportionment
of block groups, to estimate where residents live within each block
group. This avoids the simplistic assumption that people are evenly
spread out within each block group. Instead, it uses blocks to get
information about which part of a block group is where residents
actually live. There are several million blocks in the US, as compared
with fewer than a quarter million block groups. The only more accurate
approaches are 1) to use areal apportionment of blocks (not block
groups), but that is very slow, or 2) to use something like the 30x30
meter grid EPA developed using dasymetric estimates of where people live
at even higher resolution than a block, but that requires large amounts
of storage and computer time.</p>
<p>EJAM calculations also take note of which residences are near which
sites, to avoid double-counting people in the summary statistics but
still allow a user to view results for one site at a time. This is
something other tools and analyses often cannot provide - when they
aggregate across sites they typically do not retain the statistics on
individual sites, and rarely if ever keep track of which communities are
near multiple facilities. Keeping track of this would also allow an
analyst to explore how many people are near multiple sites, or ask which
sites in communities that already have multiple sites nearby.</p>
<p>EJAM was designed so that it can provide an essentially continuous
distribution of distances, as distributed across blocks or people for
one or all of the nearby facilities. This enables exploration of the
complete picture of proximities, rather than using an arbitrary single
distance defining near versus far. The distribution can be sliced later
for the summary statistics at any distance, and can be summarized as a
distribution of distances within each residential population group.</p>

<h3 id="data-updates">Data Updates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-updates"></a>
</h3>
<p>Annual data updates are synchronized with EJScreen data updates and
main version numbers, so EJScreen 2.32 (the updated version released in
August 2024) and EJAM 2.32 used the same data. Version 2.32 has ACS
2018-2022 block group residential population data and Census 2020 block
weights.</p>
