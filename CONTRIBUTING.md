# Contributing Guide

## Note on "EJAM" or "EJAM-open" repository names and package documention URLs

Please note that as of early 2025, changes may occur in exactly where the open source project will be shared, documented, and available for contributions (such as submitting Issues or Pull Requests on GitHub). A January 2025 version of the documentation website and the open source package were at two URLs that may be replaced -- The open source EJAM package was initially made available at the [EJAM-open repository](https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM-open), and documentation was initially at a URL based on EJAM not EJAM-open, but these may move.
