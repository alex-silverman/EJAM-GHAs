## Note on "EJAM" versus "EJAM-open" as the repository name

Please note that as of early 2025, changes are still being made to exactly where the open source project will be shared, documented, and available for contributions (such as submitting Issues or Pull Requests on GitHub).

The open source EJAM package was initially made available via the [EJAM-open repository](https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM-open), but an early version of the EJAM package documentation was initially published from USEPA/EJAM, so the documentation's links to source code did not work (because they required access to a separate, non-public repository). That has been corrected so that documentation is associated with the EJAM-open repository.
